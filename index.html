        <section id="history">            
            
            <p>Clonown has been celebrated in two wonderful books and has been the source of inspiration to others, including the novelist John Broderick who used the area around Clonown as the backdrop for his novel ‘The Fugitives’. Besides, we were married in the beautiful church of Our Lady of the Wayside and this strengthened our bond with Clonown.
            Clonown is one of two ‘half-parishes’ in St Peter’s parish, the second one being Drum. The placename Clonown, in common with many of our placenames which begin with ‘Cluain’, often in the form of ‘clon’ or ‘cloon’, is probably of very ancient origin. Think of such placenames as Clonmacnoise, Clontuskert, Camcloon etc. Dr P.W. Joyce, one of the pioneers of Irish placenames, tells us that the root word ‘Cluain’ is often translated as ‘lawn’ or ‘meadow’ but that “Its exact meaning, however, is a fertile piece of land, or a green arable spot, surrounded or nearly surrounded by bog or marsh on one side, and water on the other”. While it is tempting to suggest that Clonown is made up of the root words ‘Cluain’ and ‘Abhann’ meaning river it seems much more likely to be made up of ‘Cluain’ and ‘Eamhain’, a personal name. Again, it is tempting to suggest that Cluain Eamhain is named after a bishop who resided here but as many of the ‘Cluains’ are of Pagan origin it seems just as likely that Eamhain was a local Pagan chief.</p>
